        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Key Gemini Features to Demonstrate</h2>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>Choosing model for Gemini:</strong> Discuss the different Gemini models available (Flash, Pro, Advanced) and their cost and climate consequences. More powerful models consume more energy and cost more per query.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools menu:</strong> Demonstrate the Tools menu options including Deep research, Create images, and Canvas for collaborative document editing.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploading files with the + sign:</strong> Show how to use the + button to upload documents, images, and data files for analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud execution:</strong> Emphasize that all data processing and code execution happen on the cloud — your computer is just the input and output device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key NotebookLM Features to Demonstrate</h2>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>RAG encoding of uploaded files:</strong> Explain that NotebookLM looks preferentially at uploaded files, which get RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) encoded upon arrival. This means it creates a searchable index of your documents for more accurate, source-grounded responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Core use cases:</strong> NotebookLM is particularly good for interrogating and comparing documents, summarizing information across multiple sources, and even generating audio podcasts from your research materials.</li>
    <li><strong>How to share notebooks:</strong> Demonstrate the sharing feature by clicking the three-dot menu in the upper right corner of a notebook, then selecting "Share". You can share with specific people via email (within your Google Workspace) or generate a shareable link. Show how collaborators can view, comment, or edit depending on permissions granted.</li>
    <li><strong>Show how links to source documents work:</strong> When NotebookLM generates a response, demonstrate how to click on the citation numbers (e.g., [1], [2]) that appear inline in the text. These are clickable links that jump directly to the relevant passage in the source document, highlighting the exact section that supports the claim. This source-grounding is what distinguishes NotebookLM from general-purpose LLMs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructor Notes: Data Browsing Exercise (Exercise 4)</h2>

<p>
    The fake_data.xlsx file contains columns for date, temperature (F), number of bees,
    and number of butterflies. Key things to look for in participant results:
</p>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>Plot generation:</strong> Most participants should get plots, but the style and type will vary (scatter, line, bar). Good opportunity to discuss how the same prompt yields different outputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical interpretation:</strong> Did it flag that insect counts near zero at 10 F make biological sense? This tests whether the AI applies domain knowledge beyond pure statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> The bees and butterflies columns have a correlation of approximately 0.5. Did Gemini find and report this? Some runs will, some won't — depends on the model and how it interprets the prompt.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal patterns:</strong> Both insect counts and temperature follow seasonal trends. Did it identify this?</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Teaching moment:</strong> Poll the group with a show of hands for each question above.
    The variation in responses illustrates that AI outputs are non-deterministic — the same
    data and similar prompts can produce meaningfully different analyses.
</p>

<h2>Instructor Notes: Gems (Exercise 5)</h2>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>What Gems are:</strong> Custom AI assistants with a persistent prompt (system prompt) that defines their behavior. Similar to Custom GPTs in ChatGPT.</li>
    <li><strong>Key advantage over regular Gemini:</strong> The persistent prompt means you don't have to re-explain the task every time. The Gem remembers its role across conversations.</li>
    <li><strong>Creating a Gem:</strong> Access through "Gem manager" in the Gemini sidebar. Click "New Gem", write the persistent prompt, name it, optionally upload reference documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Gems can be shared with others in your Google Workspace — useful for standardizing workflows across a research group (e.g., everyone uses the same paper reviewer Gem).</li>
    <li><strong>Example Gem ideas for researchers:</strong> Paper reviewer, grant writing assistant, literature synthesizer, methods section writer, data analysis explainer, lab protocol checker.</li>
    <li><strong>Uploading documents:</strong> Like NotebookLM, you can upload reference documents (journal guidelines, style guides) that the Gem always considers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion Questions: Ethics of AI Use in Research</h2>

<p>Use these to guide the in-workshop discussion after the grant proposal exercise:</p>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>Attribution and disclosure:</strong> If you use NotebookLM to review your grant proposal,
        should you disclose this to the funding agency? What if it helps you write sections of the proposal?
        Where is the line between "tool" and "co-author"?</li>

    <li><strong>Lack of established norms:</strong> Unlike citation practices or authorship guidelines,
        which have evolved over decades, social norms for AI use in research are still emerging.
        Different journals, funding agencies, and institutions have different policies — or no policy at all.
        How do you navigate this uncertainty?</li>

    <li><strong>Competitive advantage vs. fairness:</strong> If some researchers use AI tools and others don't,
        does this create an unfair advantage? Should AI assistance be disclosed to ensure transparency?</li>

    <li><strong>Responsibility and verification:</strong> When AI identifies errors or suggests improvements,
        you are still responsible for the final work. How do you verify AI-generated insights?
        What happens if AI misses something important or provides incorrect information?</li>

    <li><strong>Clarity within your research group:</strong> It's essential to establish shared expectations
        between participants and advisors, PIs and postdocs, about appropriate AI use. These conversations should
        be explicit and ongoing. Different sub-fields are developing their own norms — some more permissive,
        others more restrictive. You need to stay abreast of evolving practices in your specific field and
        discuss them openly within your research group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Discussion Questions</h2>

<p>For wrapping up or filling time:</p>

<ul class="resources">
    <li>What worked well in Gemini's response?</li>
    <li>What could be improved?</li>
    <li>How might you refine the prompt to get better suggestions?</li>
    <li>How does this relate to using AI for research tasks?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Session Preview Notes</h2>

<p>Before concluding, briefly preview the upcoming sessions:</p>

<ul class="resources">
    <li><strong>Session 2 (Next week):</strong> We'll integrate AI directly into Python workflows using Google Colab with Gemini. Participants will learn to debug, document, and generate code with AI assistance.</li>
    <li><strong>Session 3 (Week after):</strong> We'll explore Claude Code, a powerful command-line tool that can autonomously execute multi-step coding tasks, run tests, and create complete analysis pipelines.</li>
</ul>
