You need to `!pip install` them again each time\nyou start a new session. For this reason, put your `!pip install` commands in a cell\nnear the top of your notebook so they run first every time."

Go to **File → New notebook in Drive** to create a fresh, empty notebook\n\n2. Click the **blue Gemini icon** at the bottom of the new notebook to open the chat panel\n\n3.

Do the needed pip install steps and include lots of examples\nand documentation. This is for science undergraduates.\n```\n\n4. Gemini will generate a series of cells — code and markdown — that form a complete tutorial\n\n5. Review what it produced:\n   - Does the notebook run without errors?\n   - Are the explanations clear and correct?\n   - Did it include `!pip install` for any non-standard packages?\n   - Would you trust this as a teaching resource without edits?\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nThis exercise demonstrates a key use of the Gemini chat interface:\n**generating an entire notebook structure** from a high-level description.\nThe magic wand works one cell at a time, but the Gemini chat can produce\na complete multi-cell document in one shot.
