    "\n",
    "Google Colab has **two different AI interfaces** built in. They look different,\n",
    "behave differently, and are useful in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1A. The Gemini Sidebar (Chat Icon)\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the **left sidebar** of Colab. You'll see a **sparkle/chat icon** (✨).\n",
    "Clicking it opens a chat panel where you can ask Gemini general questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it's good for:**\n",
    "- Asking general Python questions (\"How do I sort a dictionary by value?\")\n",
    "- Getting explanations of concepts (\"What is a list comprehension?\")\n",
    "- Brainstorming approaches (\"What's the best way to read a large CSV file?\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation:** The sidebar chat does **not** automatically see the code in your\n",
    "notebook cells. It's a standalone conversation, similar to chatting with ChatGPT\n",
    "or Claude. You would need to paste code into the chat for it to see your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1B. The Magic Wand (Cell-Level AI)\n",
    "\n",
    "When you click on a **code cell**, look for a small **magic wand icon** (or sparkle)\n",
    "that appears near the cell. This is Colab's cell-level AI assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it's good for:**\n",
    "- Generating code directly into a cell from a text description\n",
    "- Fixing errors in the current cell\n",
    "- Modifying existing code in the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key advantage:** The magic wand **is linked to the specific cell** you're working in.\n",
