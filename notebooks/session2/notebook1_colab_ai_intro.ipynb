When you click\non a code cell, look for a small **magic wand icon** that appears near the cell.\nThis is your AI assistant.\n\n### What the Magic Wand Can Do\n\n- **Generate code** from a plain-English description (\"Write a function that calculates the mean of a list\")\n- **Fix errors** in existing code (\"Fix this code\" after pasting broken code)\n- **Modify code** in the cell (\"Add error handling to this function\")\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe magic wand is **linked to the specific cell** you're working in.\nWhen you click it and type a prompt, Gemini reads the current cell contents\n(if any) and generates or modifies code directly in that cell.\n\nThis is different from a general-purpose chatbot — it's context-aware\nand writes code where you need it.\n\n### Examples of Good Prompts\n\n| Prompt | What Gemini Does |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| \"Write a function that converts Celsius to Fahrenheit\" | Generates a complete function in the cell |\n| \"Fix the error in this code\" | Reads the cell, identifies the bug, rewrites the code |\n| \"Add a docstring to this function\" | Adds documentation to existing code |\n| \"Plot this data as a bar chart instead\" | Rewrites a plot cell with different visualization |\n| \"Make this code more efficient\" | Refactors the cell contents |"
