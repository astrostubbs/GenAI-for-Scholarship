    "\n",
    "1. **Debugging code** — Finding and fixing errors\n",

    "\n",
    "Google Colab has **built-in Gemini integration**. You can access it in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inline suggestions**: As you type code, Gemini may suggest completions\n",
    "2. **Gemini panel**: Click the sparkle icon (✨) or press **Ctrl+Alt+Space** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Option+Space** (Mac) to open the Gemini assistant panel on the right side\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Using Gemini:\n",
    "- **Select code** before asking Gemini about it — this gives context\n",
    "- **Be specific** in your prompts (e.g., \"Add docstring to this function\" rather than \"document this\")\n",
    "- **Verify outputs** — Always check that AI-generated code works as expected\n",
    "- **Iterate** — If the first response isn't perfect, refine your prompt"
