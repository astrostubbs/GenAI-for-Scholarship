Licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0.\n\n---\n\n## What This Notebook Covers\n\nGoogle Colab runs on Google's servers, not on your laptop. That means you\n**cannot access files on your local hard drive** directly. But you can access\nfiles stored in your **Google Drive**.\n\nThis notebook shows you how to:\n\n1. **Mount** your Google Drive so Colab can see your files\n2. **Navigate** the Drive file structure from Python\n3. **Read and display an image** (testimage.png) from your Drive\n4. **Understand the file path** mapping between Drive and Colab\n\n### Before You Start\n\nMake sure you have a file called **`testimage.png`** in the top level of your\nGoogle Drive (the \"My Drive\" folder). Any PNG image will work — a photo,\na diagram, a screenshot, etc."
