Reference Guide: Intentional Errors in draft_proposal.pdf
==========================================================

This document lists the intentional errors included in the draft NSF DMREF proposal
for use in the NotebookLM exercise. Students should use NotebookLM to compare the
draft proposal against NSF guidelines and identify these compliance issues.

ERROR 1: Budget Exceeds Maximum
---------------------------------
Location: Budget Justification section (page 8)
Error: Total project cost of $2,319,000
NSF Requirement: DMREF solicitation (NSF 25-508) states awards are expected to
range from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000
Violation: Exceeds maximum by $319,000

What NotebookLM should find: The budget section shows total costs significantly
over the allowed maximum for DMREF proposals.


ERROR 2: Missing Required Section (Facilities)
-----------------------------------------------
Location: Entire document
Error: No "Facilities, Equipment, and Other Resources" section
NSF Requirement: NSF Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG)
Chapter II.D.9 requires this section describing available facilities and major
equipment
Violation: Required section completely absent

What NotebookLM should find: When comparing to the PAPPG requirements, this
mandatory section is not present in the proposal.


ERROR 3: URL Link in Proposal Text
-----------------------------------
Location: Page 3, Background and Prior Work section
Error: Contains clickable URL link: "https://github.com/chenlab/composite-ml"
NSF Requirement: NSF PAPPG states that URLs should not be used within the
Project Description as they are not subject to the same rigorous review as the
proposal content. References should be properly cited instead.
Violation: Direct URL link embedded in text

What NotebookLM should find: The proposal contains a hyperlinked URL in the
project description, which violates NSF formatting guidelines about web links.


ERROR 4: Font Size Too Small
-----------------------------
Location: Page 9, Budget Justification section, Computational Resources subsection
Error: Text formatted in small font (\small in LaTeX, approximately 9-10pt)
NSF Requirement: PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d.i specifies minimum 11-point font size
for all text in the proposal (with limited exceptions for figures and tables)
Violation: Budget justification detail text uses undersized font

What NotebookLM should find: The computational resources budget section uses
font smaller than the required 11-point minimum.


TEACHING NOTES
==============

Expected Student Experience:
- NotebookLM should identify most or all of these errors when asked to compare
  the draft against NSF guidelines
- Responses should include specific page citations from both the draft proposal
  and the relevant NSF guideline documents
- The RAG-based approach should provide direct quotes from the guidelines
  explaining why each item is an error

Discussion Points:
- How source-grounded responses differ from generic LLM outputs
- Importance of comparing documents systematically in grant writing
- Role of AI tools in catching compliance issues early in the process
- Limitations: AI may not catch everything; human review still essential

Suggested Prompts for Students:
1. "Compare the draft proposal's budget to the DMREF solicitation requirements.
    Does it meet the funding limits?"
2. "What required sections from the NSF PAPPG might be missing from this draft?"
3. "Are there any formatting violations related to fonts or links in the proposal?"
4. "Review the proposal for compliance with NSF submission guidelines."
